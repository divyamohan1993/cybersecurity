        "### **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation demonstrates a **Homomorphic Voting System** using the **Paillier encryption scheme**, which supports **additive homomorphism**. Additive homomorphism allows encrypted values to be added together without needing to decrypt them first. In this case, the system is designed for voting, where each vote is encrypted and later aggregated while still encrypted, preserving privacy. The results can only be decrypted by the election authority, ensuring the secrecy of individual votes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Objectives**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Generate Encryption Keys**: Create public and private keys using the Paillier encryption scheme.\n",
        "2. **Encrypt Votes**: Each vote is encrypted before being stored, ensuring that individual votes remain private.\n",
        "3. **Aggregate Encrypted Votes**: Add the encrypted votes without decrypting them.\n",
        "4. **Decrypt Results**: Only the election authority can decrypt the total votes, which are still secure during the aggregation process.\n",
        "5. **Vote Integrity with Hashing**: Generate a hash for each team's encrypted votes to ensure the integrity of the voting process.\n",

        "3. **Hashing for Vote Integrity**:\n",

Additionally, **hashing** ensures the integrity of votes, protecting against tampering during the election process.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this demonstration, we use **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to encrypt employee salary data using the **BFV scheme** provided by the **TenSEAL** library. FHE allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it, maintaining privacy and security throughout the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Objective**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encrypt Salary Data**: Use the **BFV scheme** from TenSEAL to encrypt salary data for employees.\n",
        "2. **Perform Operations on Encrypted Data**: We will compute the **total sum** of all encrypted salaries without decrypting them.\n",
        "3. **Decrypt Results**: Finally, decrypt and display the result, verifying that operations were performed correctly on the encrypted data.\n",

        "1. **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**:\n",
        "   - Allows computations (like addition and multiplication) to be performed on encrypted data.\n",
        "   - The result of the computation remains encrypted and can be decrypted later using the secret key.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **BFV (Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren) Scheme**:\n",
        "   - A homomorphic encryption scheme that supports addition and multiplication on encrypted integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **TenSEAL**:\n",
        "   - A Python library that provides tools for **homomorphic encryption** with easy-to-use APIs for machine learning and data privacy.\n",

        "### **Introduction:**\n",
        "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed on encrypted data, ensuring privacy and security throughout the process. FHE guarantees that even without decrypting the data, the operations can be carried out, and the result can later be decrypted to obtain the correct outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a basic FHE concept using a **Caesar Cipher**, where employee salaries are encrypted, manipulated (incremented, taxed, and bonuses added), and stored in a file. The operations are performed on the **encrypted values**, and the results are encrypted back, maintaining data privacy throughout.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Objective:**\n",
        "- Encrypt the employee's salary using Caesar Cipher (basic FHE simulation).\n",
        "- Store encrypted salaries in a file for secure retrieval.\n",
        "- Perform operations (increment, tax deduction, bonus addition) on the encrypted data.\n",

        "The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique that shifts the value by a fixed amount (`key`). While it is not suitable for actual encryption in production systems, it helps demonstrate the concept of operating on encrypted data. Here's how the Caesar Cipher works in this simulation:\n",

        "- **Encryption**: The salary is shifted by a key (e.g., `key = 3`) to encrypt the value.\n",

        "### **Key Steps of FHE Validation:**\n",
        "1. **Encrypt Salary**: When a new salary is input, it is encrypted using the Caesar Cipher and stored.\n",
        "2. **Fetch and Decrypt Salary**: When an existing employee ID is entered, the encrypted salary is retrieved, decrypted, and displayed for verification.\n",
        "3. **Perform Operations on Encrypted Data**: Operations like increment, tax deduction, and bonus addition are performed on the decrypted salary, and the results are encrypted after each operation.\n",

        "   - A **256-bit AES key** is generated and saved in a file (`aes_key.key`) for reuse across multiple sessions.\n",
        "   - The same key is used for encryption and decryption, ensuring data consistency across restarts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Employee Data Storage**:\n",
        "   - Encrypted salaries are stored in a file (`employee_salaries_aes.json`) in **hexadecimal format** for easy serialization and persistence.\n",
        "   - The encrypted data is reloaded from the file on subsequent program executions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Operations**:\n",
        "   - The program allows three operations to be performed on the decrypted salary: **increment**, **tax deduction**, and **bonus addition**.\n",
        "   - After each operation, the updated salary is encrypted and stored securely.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **First Run**:\n",
        "   - The program will **generate a new AES key** and save it in `aes_key.key`. This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt employee salary data.\n",
        "   - Employee salaries are entered, encrypted, and saved in `employee_salaries_aes.json` in hexadecimal format.\n",

        "   - The program will load the saved AES key and employee salary data from their respective files.\n",
        "   - The same key will be used to decrypt the salary data, allowing for seamless continuation of salary operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Perform Operations**:\n",
        "   - You can perform operations like increment, tax deduction, and bonus addition on decrypted salary data. After each operation, the updated salary is encrypted again and saved.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Conclusion**:\n",
        "This demonstration highlights the concepts of **encryption, decryption**, and **data persistence** using AES. The program securely handles employee salary data, ensuring that encrypted information can be manipulated and persisted across multiple sessions. This is a practical demonstration of secure encryption techniques in action, applicable to real-world scenarios like payroll systems."
