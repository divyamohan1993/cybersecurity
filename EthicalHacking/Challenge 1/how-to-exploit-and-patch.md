### **Exploit in the Environment**

The hidden vulnerability in this environment lies in the **case-insensitive comparison** of `username` and `password` fields in the MySQL database. While the PHP code uses **prepared statements** to prevent SQL Injection, it does not account for the fact that MySQL performs **case-insensitive matching** for the default `utf8_general_ci` collation.

#### **The Logic Flaw**
- MySQL treats `Admin` and `admin` as equivalent for string matching under the default collation.
- This means you can log in as the `admin` user using usernames like `Admin` or `ADMIN` and the correct password.

#### **Steps to Access the Exploit**

1. **Visit the Login Page**
   - Open the login page in your browser:
     ```
     http://<external-ip>/secure-app/
     ```

2. **Enter Exploit Input**
   - Try variations of the username, such as:
     - `Admin`
     - `ADMIN`
     - `AdMiN`
   - Use the correct password for the admin user:
     - `supersecurepassword`

3. **Validate Access**
   - If the exploit is successful, the page will display:
     ```
     Welcome, Admin!
     ```
   - This demonstrates the case-insensitivity vulnerability.

### **Why This is Hard to Detect**
1. **Security Layers**:
   - Firewalls (UFW) block all unnecessary ports.
   - ModSecurity (WAF) blocks common attack payloads like SQL Injection and XSS.
   - Prepared statements eliminate SQL Injection.

2. **No Error Messages**:
   - The login form does not display detailed error messages like "invalid username" or "invalid password," making it harder to deduce whether the issue lies with the username or password.

3. **Subtlety of Case Sensitivity**:
   - This is not a typical vulnerability like SQL Injection or XSS. It relies on understanding how databases handle string comparisons with default settings.

### **How to Validate as the Instructor**
1. Log in as a normal user first to confirm the system behaves as expected:
   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `securepassword`
   - Should display: `Welcome, user!`

2. Test the exploit:
   - Username: `Admin`
   - Password: `supersecurepassword`
   - Should display: `Welcome, Admin!`

3. If the students discover the issue, they should document:
   - How they tested the username variations.
   - Why MySQL's default collation caused the issue.
   - The steps taken to exploit it.

### **Securing This Vulnerability**
After the demonstration, explain how to fix this issue:
1. Use **binary collation** (`utf8_bin`) for strict case-sensitive matching:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users MODIFY username VARCHAR(50) COLLATE utf8_bin;
   ```
2. Hash passwords using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt):
   ```php
   password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
   ```
3. Enforce case sensitivity in the application layer by normalizing inputs (e.g., converting to lowercase).
